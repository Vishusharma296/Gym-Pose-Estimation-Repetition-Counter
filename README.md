# Gym-Pose-Estimation-Repetition-Counter
The goal of this project is to create a lightweight pose estimation system that takes a video stream (live or recorded) of a person performing exercises (e.g., pushups, squats, dumbbell curls), detects body landmarks, analyzes joint angles, and counts the number of completed repetitions per exercise.
